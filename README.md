# cpp-timbreID
An audio feature extraction library for the JUCE framework.  
Porting of [wbrent/timbreID](https://github.com/wbrent/timbreID) [1] (original Pure Data external).  
A wrapper for [aubio/aubio](https://github.com/aubio/aubio)'s onsed detector is included.

This work was used for the paper **Embedded Real-time Classification of Playing Techniques on a Smart Guitar** which was submitted to *IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing*.
The code for the timbre classifier mentioned in the article is in [/master/Demos/Demo-guitarTimbreClassifier](https://github.com/domenicostefani/cpp-timbreID/tree/master/Demos/Demo-guitarTimbreClassifier)
