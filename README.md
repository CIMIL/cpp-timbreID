# cpp-timbreID
An audio feature extraction library for the JUCE framework.  
Porting of [wbrent/timbreID](https://github.com/wbrent/timbreID) [1] (original Pure Data external).  
A wrapper for [aubio/aubio](https://github.com/aubio/aubio)'s onsed detector is included.

A earlier version of this code was used for the paper **On the challenges of embedded real-time audio classification** which was submitted to the 25th International Conference on Digital Audio Effects (DAFx20in22).
The code for the timbre classifier mentioned in the article is in [/master/Demos/Demo-guitarTimbreClassifier](https://github.com/domenicostefani/cpp-timbreID/tree/master/Demos/Demo-guitarTimbreClassifier)
